        // Example of breakpoints to debug.
        // Selecting the line where print is will place a breakpoint (a blue marker will appear).
        // Clicking again will disable the breakpoint, right click and select "delete breakpoint" to remove it.
        // Breakpoints can be made conditional. Right clicking a breakpoint and selecting "edit breakpoint" opens up another window where a condition can be entered. This means the breakpoint will only be hit is that condition is true.
